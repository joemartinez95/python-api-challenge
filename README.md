For this assignment we were tasked with pulling data from two different sources using API keys and running analysis on weather trends while also finding nearby hotels for a group of cities.

Assistance was received for some lines of code throughout the assignment:

WeatherPy file in cell 3 for the line 'response = requests.get(city_url).json()' assistance was provided by AskBCS assistance from Angel.

VacationPy file in cell 4 for plotting maps assistance was provided by classmate Casey Scow.
